We are two Spanish brothers who love video games. We grew up in the Game Boy and Super Nintendo era.
Since then we have not stopped playing hundreds of games both on different consoles and on a computer.
We continue to enjoy like when we were children.

Vestigia Studios was born with the aim of expressing our enthusiasm for video games in our own works.
Our origins make us passionate about old school and retro games. We look for classic genres but incorporating
novel touches that have not been considered to date or treated as we think it should be.
We want to contribute our grain of sand to the world of videogames and return our passion for games and, ultimately, make emotions feel
that we have felt so many times when playing.
